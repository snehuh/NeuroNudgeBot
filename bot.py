''' Neuro Nudge Bot: The Bot that reminds you of you of your tasks at random intervals to surprise you

This is the first version of this bot and it is very static with the bare minimum functions

To be done later:
1. Communicate to bot what your task is 
2. Create custom messages to remind you
3. Increase or decrease frequency - total number 
4. Add any images along with the message

And more!
